"""How Excel orders and matches text in a filter.

Measured against Excel's own filters rather than taken from a sort
specification: a column of words, a ``>`` criterion per word, and the rows
Excel kept recorded, so every pair's order is Excel's answer. What that
showed is Windows' word sort with case ignored.

**Letters by their base, accents only to break a tie.** ``e < é < f``
and ``resume < résume < résumé``: an accent matters only between words
that are otherwise the same, and then from the left. Case never matters,
and a ligature is its letters: ``æ`` is ``ae`` and ``ß`` is ``ss``, equal
and not merely adjacent.

**Symbols first, then digits, then letters.** Space sorts lowest, then
the no-break space, then ASCII punctuation in the order below, then the
common non-ASCII symbols, all before ``0``. Greek follows Latin.

**Apostrophe and the hyphens are ignored until the very end.** ``coop <
co-op < cop``: the hyphen does not separate ``co`` from ``op``. It only
decides between words that are otherwise equal, and there ``'`` comes
before ``-``, then the en dash, then the em dash. So ``coop`` and ``co-op``
are not equal, which matters to a value list.

**Wildcards match character by character.** ``*`` any run, ``?`` one
character, ``~`` escapes either or itself. Case is ignored; accents and
ligatures are not, so ``a*e`` matches ``ae`` but not ``æ``, and ``a*`` does
not match ``ábc``.

Trimming is not collation: Excel trims a cell's text before comparing it
and compares a criterion as it is written. That happens in the filter, not
here.

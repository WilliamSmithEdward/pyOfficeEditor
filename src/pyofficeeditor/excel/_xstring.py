"""Text as SpreadsheetML stores it, which is not quite as XML stores it.

XML cannot carry most control characters at all, and a carriage return or
a line break in an attribute does not survive being read. SpreadsheetML's
string type, ST_Xstring, spells such a character ``_xHHHH_`` instead, by
its UTF-16 code in hex, and spells the underscore of anything that would
read as an escape ``_x005F_``, so a cell holding ``_x0041_`` keeps it.

Measured, for every character below U+0020 and the others XML refuses,
across a cell's text, a formula and its result, a note, a threaded comment,
a header, a validation, a hyperlink, a table's column, a sheet's name and
a defined name's comment. Excel writes the two places differently:

- In element text the hex is uppercase. A tab and a line feed are written
  as they are, a line feed as CRLF, and a carriage return is escaped,
  since an XML reader turns a bare one into a line feed.
- In an attribute the hex is lowercase, and a tab, a line feed and a
  carriage return are all escaped, since an XML reader turns each into a
  space there.

Excel reads either spelling in either place, with the hex digits in either
case. ``_X0041_``, with a capital X, is not an escape, and neither is one
short a digit or its closing underscore. A NUL reads back as one, though
Excel's object model cuts text at a NUL when it is given one.
